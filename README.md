Developed and implemented a robust image classification model using YOLOv8 and Yolov11 which are models of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for Object Detection.We used this to
analyze the level of formality in college student attire. Employed Roboflow for data annotation and leveraged the Google Colab platform for model training and deployment. This project involved data
 preprocessing, model selection and performance evaluation by comparing the results of YOLOv8 and YOLOv11. The results provides that YOLOv11 provide greater accuracy after long duration than YOLOv8.
